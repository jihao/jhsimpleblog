**aims to make a free simple blog system using jsp & servlet & mysql**

**aims to make me get familiar with presentation layer technology and the 3-layer web application design**

**this simple blog system also cares about the usability issue, it uses fckeditor as WYSIWYG editor, also there's some ajax in it.**

```
jquery-1.2.6.js was used as ajax lib.
 + jquery.validation.js (validation plugin)
```

**After all it's hard to find a cheap or free jsp hosting on the web, I stopped the developement of this blog system, seems it turns out to be another wheel I invented, anyway developing this simpleblog really helped me get familiar with jsp & servlet related technoledge, its worth a try !**
